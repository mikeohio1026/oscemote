# Introduction #

In this example, we'll use the shareware program OSCulator to bridge the OSC messages to MIDI which will in turn control Garage Band.  You'll need to download and install [OSCulator](http://www.osculator.net/wiki/Main/Download/) and use [Garage Band](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/) or any other MIDI aware software package.

  * Make sure you have [OSCulator version 2.6.1](http://www.osculator.net/wiki/Main/Download) or later.  Earlier versions won't work with this tutorial.
  * Download and open this OSCulator settings file: http://lux.vu/iphone/oscemote/OSCemoteMIDI.oscd
  * Now open a new Garage Band document (it should have one instrument already).
  * Now launch OSCemote on your iPhone.
  * Go to the Settings tab in OSCemote and press the Scan button.  This should auto-detect the IP address of your computer and the port that OSCulator is listening on.
  * If you have trouble with this, make sure your computer's System Preferences, Security, Firewall settings will allow OSCulator to receive incoming connections.
  * Now switch to the buttons view in OSCemote and press one.
  * You should hear some awesome music from Garage Band.
