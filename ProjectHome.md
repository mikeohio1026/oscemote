OSCemote is an iPhone/iPod Touch App that sends Open Sound Control (OSC) messages over WiFi.  See the [OSCemote Home Page](http://pixelverse.org/iphone/oscemote/) or the [OSCemote Product Page on iTunes](http://itunes.com/app/oscemote) for an overview.

This Google Code project contains OSCemote custom panels, helpful utilities for integrating OSCemote with your favorite music software or programming language as well as tutorials on how to use them all together.  OSCemote itself is not open source, but all of these utilities, patches and tutorials are.
